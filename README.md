# ECCO
A website designed for users to offer and hire basic maintenance and cleaning services.

The website was developed as a trainee project for our entry into the junior enterprise 'Cati Jr.', located at the Federal University of São Carlos in São Carlos, Brazil.

!!! The project was not completed due to the need to conclude the trainee period, some parts are not finished and don't represent the final product
